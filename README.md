# Mancala

### Game Background:
According to The Spruce Crafts:

> Mancala is a game where players "sow" and "capture" seeds. Historians believe that mancala may have originated with the dawn of civilization as a record-keeping technique, a harvesting ritual, or a divination tool. There's evidence that the game was played thousands of years ago in ancient Sumeria (modern-day Iraq), in ancient Sudan on the upper Nile River, and Egypt. Ancient mancala game boards have been unearthed in Zimbabwe, Uganda, and Ghana. Mancala made its way to the United States when enslaved Africans brought over the game.
